# Project Title

The Project is using of Smart contracts to link them to frontend application for necessary tasks.

## Description

This Solidity smart contract, named "Assessment," manages Ethereum (ETH) funds. It allows users to deposit ETH into the contract and withdraw ETH from it, with the restriction that only the owner of the contract can perform these actions. The contract keeps track of the ETH balance and emits events when funds are deposited or withdrawn. The owner is set upon deployment of the contract, and the contract initializes with an initial ETH balance specified by the constructor parameter _eth.
After that we have to link our smart contact to frontend application using the java script and have to link metamask wallet for transaction.
